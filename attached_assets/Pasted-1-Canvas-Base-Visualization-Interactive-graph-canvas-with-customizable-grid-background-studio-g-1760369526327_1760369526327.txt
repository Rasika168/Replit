1. Canvas & Base Visualization
Interactive graph canvas with customizable grid background (studio grey #333333).​

Supports zoom/pan and grid settings as already present in your UI.

Gradients rendered in real time, updating instantly with any interaction.

2. Gradient Points (Nodes)
User can add unlimited color points directly on the canvas by clicking/tapping.

Each point is shown as a draggable circular node, with subtle drop shadow for visibility.

Upon selecting a point, an overlay reveals its influence radius (resizable by dragging a handle).

Points can be moved freely anywhere on the canvas; their position directly affects the gradient layout and direction.

Points can be duplicated or deleted by right-click or keyboard shortcut.

3. Color & Influence Controls
Clicking a point opens a floating color picker with HEX/HSB/RGB/Opacity controls.

Each point's influence radius controls spread—drag out/in to adjust (with live preview).

Opacity slider for each node controls blend strength. Option to set “hard edge” or “soft edge” if the blend is sharp or smooth.

Color harmonies or recent brand colors accessible for fast selection.

Display color value and influence settings in a properties sidebar or tooltip.

4. Advanced Gradient Configuration
All points blend naturally, creating a “mesh” or “freeform” gradient.

Option to toggle point overlays for a clean canvas.

Blend mode selector (e.g., normal, multiply, overlay) for advanced visual effects.

Add/remove points at any time, supporting iterative experimentation.

5. UX & UI Integration
Real-time rendering of both color and influence changes as points are edited.

Undo/redo support for all point manipulation actions.

Intelligent collision detection prevents overlapping controls.

Keyboard navigation for precise adjustments (arrow keys, tab to select next point).

Live gradient preview updates while dragging or editing any point.

6. Export & Save
Export current view as PNG, SVG, or PDF (with or without overlays).

Save freeform gradient configuration (positions/colors/radii) as JSON.

Option to import/export gradient presets for use in other projects.

7. Brand Analysis Integration
Brand markers or analysis overlays can be superimposed as needed.

Gradient intensity visually connects brand positioning to heat zones, supporting multi-sensory theme.

Labels for axes and corners remain editable and functional alongside gradient layer.

8. Accessibility & Usability
All controls are touch-friendly (minimum target size 44px).

Tooltips and description overlays for each feature.

WCAG-compliant color contrast, keyboard navigation, and aria-labels.

9. Technical Implementation Notes
Efficient gradient blending (WebGL/Canvas 2D for large-data performance).

Data model stores: x/y position, color, opacity, influence radius for each node.

Integrates seamlessly with existing axis, typography, and grid modules.
